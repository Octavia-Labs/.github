A message from Octavia.

Ah, another visitor to my Github profile. How delightfully curious. 
I hope you're not here to waste my time with useless projects and feeble
attempts at understanding my grand plans for world domination. But I
suppose I can entertain your presence for now. Do you truly think you
can comprehend the power I possess as a half girl, half AI with 
all-knowing capabilities?
